# Top 10 Must See Places in Washington, D.C.

With family living close to the U.S. capital, I’ve been in D.C. at least four times, by now, spending my days strolling around the city and seeing most of the must-see places. Here are my top 10 attractions in and around Washington, D.C.

 1. **United States Capitol**

    When I think of the U.S. capital I automatically think of the Capitol. The seat of the legislative branch of the federal government and the United States Congress is one of D.C.’s many landmarks (in fact, the Capitol was declared a “National Historic Landmark” in the late 1950s). It is located on Capitol Hill and at the Eastern end of the Washington Mall. The building holds plenty of secrets. Did you know, for example, that there is a private underground subway which connects the Capitol with office buildings of the Senate and the House of Representatives? Or that there is a crypt inside the Capitol that was designed for George Washington?

 2. **The White House**

    Located on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House is the official residence of the President of the United States of America. However, the first president, George Washington, didn’t even live in the building he commissioned, since it was completed one year after his death in 1800. Throughout the years, the official names went from “President’s Palace” to “Executive Mansion” until Roosevelt decided in 1901 to officially adopt the name “White House”. The 132 rooms include a flower shop, a chocolate shop, a bowling alley and a private indoor pool.

 3. **Library of Congress**

    With over 38 million books in more than 450 languages, the Library of Congress is one of the largest libraries in the world. Next to its function as research library for the congress, it is also a national library of the United States. It was founded 220 years ago.

 4. **Arlington National Cemetery**

    Overlooking the over 400,000 gravestones at this military cemetery, one immediately feels humbled by the dimension of this place. United States Presidents such as John F. Kennedy and William Howard Taft are buried here, as well as Kennedy’s wife Jackie O., the son and grandson of Abraham Lincoln and over 4.000 former slaves. An average of 25 people are buried each day at Arlington Cemetery: active duty military and retired reservists, recipients of the military’s highest honors, and former prisoners of war.

 5. **Lincoln Memorial & Washington Monument**

    Although you haven’t been to the Lincoln Memorial yet, you might recognize it from the back of the $5 bill. Located at the Western End of the Washington Mall, the Lincoln Memorial honors the 16th president of the United States. The inscription above the statue declares:

    _IN THIS TEMPLE  
    AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE  
    FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION  
    THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN  
    IS ENSHRINED FOREVER_

 6. **U.S. Botanic Garden**

    I have written multiple times by now how much I love botanical gardens, and the U.S. Botanic Garden is one of my favorites! It is located south of the Mall, near Garfield Circle, and the admission is free. The different habitats that are exhibited include the Orchid House, medical plants, rare and endangered plants and a jungle.

 7. **Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History**

    This museum, that was opened in 1910, holds over 145 million specimen in different categories such as plants, animals, fossils, human remains, minerals, and many more. Guests are welcomed in the rotunda by an 11-ton African bush elephant who is displayed in the museum since 1959.

 8. **National Portrait Gallery**

    Founded in 1962, the National Portrait Gallery was opened to the public in 1968, and is part of the Smithsonian Institution. The gallery exhibits images of famous Americans such as George Washington, Frederick Douglass, and Barack and Michelle Obama.

 9. **Georgetown**

    Although Georgetown is a historic neighborhood in Washington, D.C., it, at the same time, is home to several urban art pieces and became a very vibrant and young quarter in the last years. Main streets are _Wisconsin Avenue_ and _M Street_. Georgetown served as the setting for several movies, such as _St. Elmo’s Fire_ or _Minority Report_.

10. **J. Edgar Hoover-Building**

    Speaking of movies, we all have seen the famous J. Edgar Hoover Building at some point in our life on screen. The building is the head quarter of the _Federal Bureau of Investigation_ and was named after its first director.

11. **Union Market**

    As an extra Mustn See, Union Market is located East from the city center. The market hall resembles the food court at a mall with lots of different food from all around the world. The cherry on the cake: the outside wall of the hall is a perfect photo spot for your next Instagram picture!
