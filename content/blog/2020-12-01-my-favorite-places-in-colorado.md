I’ve said it once, I’ll say it a million times: I’d chose mountains over the ocean any time. And this love comes from visiting the Rocky Mountains so often in the last couple of years.

Before my family moved to the East coast, they lived in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado. Although I could probably also make a list of my favorite places in the _mile high city_, today I want to share the most dreamy places in the centennial state.

* Estes Parks

  This is it. This is the place. Estes Parks is the most beautiful village I have ever seen in my entire life! It is located 7,522 ft above sea level, close to the Rocky Mountain National Park. The majority of the three million visitors of the National Park use Estes Park as their base.   
  Fun Fact: the _Stanley Hotel_ inspired the American author Stephen King to write his famous novel _The Shining_. It, however, is not the same hotel that is shown in the movie adaption.

* Boulder

  What Münster is in Germany, Boulder is in Colorado (or even in the whole U.S.?): a university town. The _University of Colorado_ has it’s main campus in Boulder, which means that a large amount of the people living in the city are actually students. The city frequently receives high rankings in art, health, well-being, quality of life, and education, and was even voted the Happiest City in 2011.   
  Oh and by the way, Stephen King (you know, the guy that was so inspired by the _Stanley Hotel_) actually moved to Boulder after visiting Estes Park, and wrote _The Shining_ there.

* _Cheyenne Mountain Zoo_  
  Moving from the North of Colorado to the state’s center. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo is located in Colorado Springs, 60 miles south of Denver.   
  The Zoo (as the name suggests) is located on Cheyenne Mountain, 6,714 feet above sea level, and is considered the highest zoo in the United States. It was opened in 1926 and houses more than 750 animals today. It represents 150 different species, 30 of these are considered endangered species.   
  Especially their giraffe population is huge and, as a visitor, you can even feed them with provided greens.

* _Denver Downtown Aquarium_

  This public aquarium was opened in 1999 and houses more than 5.000 animals from over 500 different species. The two major themes are the path of the Colorado River and the Kampar River in Indonesia on their respective way to the ocean.  
    
  I usually am not the biggest fan of putting wild animals in cages, but both the _Cheyenne Mountain Zoo_ and the _Downtown Aquarium_ have really large enclosures and are a great way of getting to know foreign species face-to-face.

* Red Rocks Amphitheater

  Have you ever been to a concert in the mountains? The Red Rocks Amphitheater ist built into a rock structure and offers over 9.000 seats for music loving guests. Artists such as Jimi Hendrix, The Blues Brothers, or U2 have played in the amphitheater in the past.

* Literally everywhere  
  If you drive through the Rocky Mountains, just stop for a second at the next lookout and admire the view on the mountains. I promise, you won’t regret it!
