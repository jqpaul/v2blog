###### When I turned 18 my mother gifted me with a cruise to Oslo, Norway. It seems like we both really enjoyed spending 20+ hours on the ocean, then doing sightseeing for 4 hours before spending another 22 hours on a boat, because last year, we did it again!

This time we went to Gothenburg in Sweden. It took us ‘only’ 15 hours from Kiel to get there, and of course flying would have been an option as well, but, you know, the vibe is different when you’re on a cruise ship all alone in the middle of the Baltic Sea.

I have a very strong obsession with Scandinavian countries. I love their culture, their furniture, the whole concept of _hygge_ and even started to learn Swedish in uni for a few years.

We went to Gothenburg in July  and were fortunate to have a very sunny and bright day that we spent in the city. At this point, some words about me: if I plan a trip, I PLAN it. I visit every website of the places I want to see, I check the admission for all of these places and I find out how to connect sight A and sight B the quickest way possible. Especially if I do not have that much time at a certain place, I want to make the most of the time that I have and not waste it by deciding where to go first or how to get there.  
No, I worked out a precise plan. And let me tell you, it was worth it!

We had eight hours to spend in Gothenburg. My mum and I started our day by taking the boat taxi to the city center where we had our first (and secretly one of my favorite) stop: _fika_. Fika is another of those Scandinavian concepts that I deeply love. It basically describes a moment to slow down to appreciate the good things in life, such as coffee. For us that meant breakfast. Do I need to tell you that we had cinnamon rolls (_Kanelbullar)_ or is that something you could have guessed by now?

We then went to the [Gothenburg Botanical Garden](https://www.goteborg.com/en/botaniska-tradgarden/) which was such a bright and beautiful place. Since it was still so early in the morning on a weekday, there weren’t many other people around. I really don’t know why but botanical gardens always calm me down, especially if I basically have them for my own (I have been to so many of them by now, maybe I should write a blogpost only about botanical gardens). We spent a lot of time there, walking through the conservatory and admiring all different kinds of plants, before making a quick stop for some soft serve.

We walked towards the harbor, saw the old town of Gothenburg and the famous feskekörka before heading to the city's most vibrant neighborhood, Haga. Here, we stood in line for 30 minutes to buy the biggest kanelbulle (yes, again!) I’ve ever seen and walked to _Slottskogen_ to admire the view on the city.  
We then made our way back to _Lilla Bommen_ where the boat taxi picked us up and brought us back to the cruise ship. We arrived in our cabin 13 minutes before departure and spent our evening on deck admiring the amazing Gothenburg archipelago.

These mini cruises are a perfect way to spend time with a loved person while visiting a new place. It was lovely to get to know the city, however, we would very much like to come back and spend some more time in beautiful Gothenburg!
