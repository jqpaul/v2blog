###### On March 11 in boarded a plane to Budapest ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º, planning to stay for a week. On March 15, Hungary closed its borders.

I admit it, in the beginning of COVID in Europe (which was around February 2020) I didnâ€™t think much of it. I knew that it would affect people but I rather thought of it as a being bad cold and not the deadly virus that it is. We all had this one moment when we realized that the situation is serious. I had this realization right after I left the country.

In December 2019, I decided to spoil me and my two best friends with a trip to Budapest in March 2020. Budapest is my absolute favorite city and I wanted to show them why. I have been in the city a couple of times and knew the places I wanted to show my friends. I planned sightseeing tours and a visit of the famous _SzÃ©chenyi thermal bath_.

As the trip came nearer, especially one of my friends (who, in my defense, is an extreme hypochondriac) considered cancelling due to COVID. However, none of us three took the situation as serious as it already was by then, which is why we boarded our plane on March 11, 2020.

The first days in Budapest were great. I showed my friends around and I was surprised how empty the whole city was. However, something did not feel right. This one hypochondriac friend spent most of his time on his phone, looking up the newest infection rates, and I have to admit in the beginning this was rather annoying than helpful. This changed throughout the trip.

We all, at some point, felt the need to go home. Since Day 1, we spent our evenings debating whether we should fly home early or not. Since, at this point, you werenâ€™t able to change your flight for free, we had to buy three completely new tickets. We called our parents and asked for their advice but they were just as unsure about our situation as we were.  
When we read online, on the morning of March 13, that the Foreign Office would not be able to bring citizens home who are stranded in other countries, we, finally, came to a decision.

**At 11 AM**  
we booked the next possible flight to Germany, no matter which city.  
**At 3 PM**  
we left our Airbnb and drove to the airport  
**At 6 PM**  
we boarded the plane (this was by far the fastest boarding I ever experienced, everyone on this plane truly wanted to go home as fast as possible)  
**At 8 PM**  
we landed in Berlin  
**At 11:30 PM**  
we boarded a bus to Hannover  
**At 3:30 AM**  
our families picked us up from the station  
**At 4:30 AM**  
I arrived in my bed  
**At 12 AM on March 15,**  
Hungary closed its borders, meaning that we would not have made it out on time if we stayed with our original return flight.
