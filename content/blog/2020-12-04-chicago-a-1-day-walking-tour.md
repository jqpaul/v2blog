When I roadtripped across the country, Chicago was one of the most anticipated stops on the route. Although I stayed only for a couple of hours in the city, I want to share with you how to make the most out of this time.

My rule of thumb is: always go to the most crowded places first.  
I usually start my sightseeing tours early in the morning and chances are high that the must-see attractions are comparatively empty at this time. When I came to Chicago, the temperatures dropped below -20Â°C, bus tours weren't operating and the city was pretty empty thorughout the whole day which was very convenient. However, I would not suggest (especially for the sake of your nose and fingertips) to spend a whole day outside sightseeing in such cold weather.

Our tour started at **Navy Pier**. Although it was this cold, the sun was shining and the multiple sheets of ice on Lake Michigan reflected the blue of the sky, making the scenery appear absolutely beautiful and bright. Most shops at the Pier were closed due to the still very early time and the weather conditions, but we had a great time strolling around and taking pictures on an empty tourist attraction.

We then made our way downtown to walk the **Magnificient Mile**. This is one of the main streets in downtown Chicago with lots of luxurious boutiques. At this point, you might want to walk south to visit the Bean, or, as it is officially called, **Cloud Gate**. The [**Art Institute of Chicago**](https://www.artic.edu/) is also located nearby.

After strolling the Magnificient Mile and enjoying some hot chocolate at _Ghirardellis_, we walked North to the **John Hancock Center**. This skyscraper was completed in 1969 and from its [observation deck](https://360chicago.com/) at the 94th floor one has a great view on the city and Lake Michigan. On clear days, you can see more than 130km far.

After spending some time up in the air and admiring the view, we made our way back to the ground and walked further north, past the **Oak Street Beach** and the [**Chicago History Museum**](https://www.chicagohistory.org/), and finally entered **Lincoln Park**.  
Lincoln Park is the largest public park in Chicago, and the second-most-visited city park in the United States (after Central Park, but you already knew that). We wanted to visit the [**Lincoln Park Zoo**](https://www.lpzoo.org/) which usually is open all year long and offers free entrance. 

Unfortunately, due to the weather conditions, the zoo was closed but there are far more things to see in Lincoln Park. You could stroll along the **North Avenue Beach**, go to the [**conservatory**](http://lincolnparkconservancy.org/projects/conservatory-garden/), or take a look at the **Ulysses S. Grant Memorial**.
