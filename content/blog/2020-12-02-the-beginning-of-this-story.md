### Hej!

I am so happy you’re here.   
I’ve created this place mainly for myself but I am more than happy if you, too, find some comfort on being here. Before I go a little bit more into detail what this blog is about, I would like to start with breaking down the title of it: _ataraxisom_.

_Ataraxis_ is a greek term that refers to the absence of mental stress or anxiety, and can be equated with serenity. Personally, I understand it as a place where you can fully be yourself without being pressured by any instance. The ending “-som” is the abbreviation for _state of mind_ and refers once again to a place of ease and comfort. I hope that ataraxisom will be exactly this place for me. I love the brownie point that the word starts with the same letter as my name, making it even more personal and dear to me.

I mainly initiated this blog because I felt very uncertain in my current situation and wanted to create some sort of stability and a place where I can write about my current thoughts and ideas. I have always find joy writing and wanted to create a safe haven where I can find peace..

This blog will be a contemporary document and sort of a diary. I will look back, I will look into my own future, and what is right in front of me. I am so thrilled of what the future will bring and the person I am going to be. And it makes me so happy to know that I’ll have you by my side! ♡
