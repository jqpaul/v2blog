###### This current pandemic makes me want to look back at all the amazing places I have seen so far. 

A travel that I truly keep in good memory is the road trip I did with my aunt and cousin in March 2019. My U.S. based family moved from Colorado to the East Coast and my aunt and I took the possibility to drive the 1686 miles between Denver and D.C.

##### Denver - North Platte

Our journey started on February 28 in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado. We left in the morning with tons of snacks, my cousin in the back seat, and an epic road trip playlist. We planned that we wouldn’t drive longer than four hours each day, which basically led us to having our first stop in the middle of nowhere: North Platte, Nebraska.  
I, by no means, intend to be disrespectful here but there was truly nothing in North Platte, except for a child’s museum and a pizza place. We saw both. My cousin, which was three at that time, loved the museum – but the pizza even more. Although this first stop on our trip might seem as a disappointment at first, let me tell you, it wasn't! And there's one reason for that: tru. We stayed at the _Tru by Hilton_ and, boy, their pillows were the softest I ever laid my head on. I still think about these pillows, more than one and a half years after the trip!

Reading my description, you might think that North Platte is not the most touristy place in the U.S. (or even Nebraska), and guess what: you are absolutely right!  
HOWEVER, if I learnt one thing during this road trip, it is that the United States are not only cities and skyscrapers. There is a lot of land between N.Y. and L.A., and during these first four hours of driving to North Platte, we approximately saw not more than two hands full of houses. As our road trip continued, I learned that this would noch much change until we arrive in Chicago.
