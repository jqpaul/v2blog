I’ve been to Oslo twice but only for a couple of hours each time. However, I would like to share with you my favorite moments and attractions in the city and on my way there:

* **Oslofjord**

  Both times I went to Oslo by taking the _Color Line_ cruise ship from Kiel. It takes 22 hours from Northern Germany to Southern Norway but the ride is worth it! Not only did we see lovely sunsets in the middle of the ocean, we also crossed the Oslofjord, which was spectacular. Several small islands in front of forested hills and tiny houses painted in Falu red all over. This whole scenery screams: welcome to Scandinavia!

* **Dyna Fyr**

  This cute little lighthouse is located on a tiny island right in the middle of the Oslofjord. Imagine sitting on one of these windows, drinking some hot chocolate on a cold and snowy winter morning. Isn’t this the epitome of coziness?

* **Aker Brygge**

  While walking from the pier to the city center, you cross Aker Brygge, one of Oslo’s quarters. Aker Brygge has a lovely marina and promenade where you can take a break and watch boats come and go. Both the Nobel Peace Center and the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art are located in this neighborhood.

* **Royal Palace**  
  _Det kongelike slot_ is one of Oslo’s many landmarks. The palace is the official residence of the current Norwegian monarch, King Harald the Fifth. It is located in the center of the _slottsparken_, a public park. A popular tourist attraction is the daily changing of the guards in front of the palace.

* **Karl Johans gate**  
  Between the Royal Palace and the main train station, the Karl Johans gate is located. This is Oslo’s main street with several famous institutions nearby, such as the Oslo Cathedral, the national theatre, the _Grand Hotel_, and the _Grand Café_.

* **_Operahuset_**

  Since 2008 the Oslo Opera House is the national opera theatre in Norway. The building resembles a floating iceberg and is located south of the main station, close to the shore. Due to its architecture, visitors can walk up the roof of the opera and admire the view on the city.

* **Oslo Cathedral**

  What _Westminster Abbey_ is for the Brits, the Oslo Cathedral is for the Norwegians. Both King Harald V and his son Crown-Prince Haakon married their respective spouses here, Queen Sonja and Crown-Princess Mette-Marit. The cathedral was built in 1697 and renovated from 2006 to 2010.
