While successfully procrastinating and not working on my master's thesis, I browsed my hard drive and discovered some pictures from my very first trip to the United States back in 2013. My brother and I went to Florida to visit our family and, of course, we decided to do the most touristy things while abroad.   
Here are eight activities that made it to our list and that you, too, should definitely not miss:

##### Take a dip in the Atlantic Ocean at South Beach

If you visit Florida outside rain and hurricane season, chances are high that the weather is good enough for you to take a swim in the Atlantic Ocean. Go for it! And enjoy the beach while being there!

##### Walk along Miami's Ocean Drive

For me, thinking about Miami automatically leads to thinking about South Beach and especially the Ocean Drive, the easternmost street in the neighborhood. Several aesthetically pleasing buildings are located on this street and form the Art Deco Historic District. One famous adress is the _Casa Casurina_, also known as the _Versace Mansion_, where fashion icon Gianni Versace lived until his death in 1997.

##### Visit the _Universal Studios_

I'm pretty sure not one tourist ever left Florida without visiting either the _Universal Studios_ or _Disney World_. Both theme parks are major tourist attractions and welcome millions of people each year.

##### Walk up and down Orlando's International Drive

Since we already are in Orlando, why not taking a stroll through one of the major streets in the city. Various tourist attractions are located on I-Drive, such as _Sea World_, Madame Tussauds, the world's tallest slingshot AND the world's largest _McDonalds_ (yes, the last fact makes me the happiest: from Belgian waffles to pasta and pizza, they have everything one German foodlover can wish for)!

##### Learn about aerospace at the _Kennedy Space Center_

Let's stay in the greater Orlando area. The _Kennedy Space Center_ has been _NASA_'s primary launch center of human spaceflight since 1968. On July 16, 1969, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins started in the spaceflight "Apollo 11" from Cape Canaveral and later successfully landed on the moon (you may have heard Armstrong's famous words by now: "thatâ€™s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"). You can read and hear all about it in several exhibitions at the center!

##### Browse _Sawgrass Mills_

With more than 329 shops, the _Sawgrass Mills Mall_ is the largest single story outlet mall in the United States of America. Whatever your heart desires, I promise, you can find it here. We spent four hours at the mall and still did not see every single shop.

##### Take an Airboat adventure through the Everglades

The _Everglades National Park_ is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States. It contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere and is home to more than 740 different species, including the Florida Panther, the West Indian Manatee and the American crocodile. Especially the last one can be seen while taking an airboat tour through the tropical marshland.

##### Go deep-sea fishing

This one is an insider's tip rather than a typical tourist attraction. One evening we entered a boat, each grabbed a fishing-rod and spend the next 5 hours on the Atlantic Ocean, secretely hoping that our catch would be the biggest.  
The icing on the cake: from the ocean you have a really great view on, in our case, Fort Lauderdale's "skyline".
