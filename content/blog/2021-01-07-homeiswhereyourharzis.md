When I changed my profile picture on social media using one of the snapshots we took this day, a friend of mine immediately texted me, asking if I'm either in Norway or used a _Zoom_ background for this picture. When I told her that my best friend took this picture of me in the middle of Germany, she couldn't believe it.  
Neither could I when I first went to the Harz.

I haven't been in the mountains in the South of Lower Saxony since I was in elementary school and I really don't know why! Unlike 95% of all the people I know, I prefer winter of summer, and these snowy mountains and forests are literally the epitome of a wonderland for me.

I have to admit, although I really like to spend time outdoors, I'm not much of a hiking person. When my best friend and I arived in Torfhaus to start our "walk" (as it was still called at this point), we both simply wanted to enjoy the snow and being outdoors during the second lockdown in Germany. The masses that came to visit the Harz between Christmas and New Year's Eve were luckily gone by now, and it felt as if we had the whole forest for ourselves.

Well, what can I say, our little walk turned into a 16km hike to the highest summit, the _Brocken_.  
Uphill.  
In fresh snow.  
And a snowstorm for the last 2 km.  
And yes, if you take a closer look at these pictures, you can see that I'm wearing Doc Martens. As much as I love them, these boots are not made for walking!

Apart from the aching feet/legs/hips/back/everything after such an unusual sporting activity, we had the best day ever, taking plenty of pictures from this amazing landscape, breathing fresh air after weeks indoors, and reminiscing about past (and upcoming!) adventures.
