###### ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­Chicago broke my heart. I left it there.

We arrived in Chicago in the afternoon, having cozy -17.5°C. My aunt used to work in the city as an au-pair after high school, so we spend the evening visiting her host family and the house where “Home Alone” (one of the best Christmas movies ever btw) was shot.

After dinner we went to bed early and mentally prepared ourselves for the upcoming day. Although it was going to be freezing cold, we wanted to spend the day in the city, doing all the touristy stuff like visiting the Hancock building and the zoo. Since walking around with a three-year-old CAN be quite stressful, we booked a bus tour in advance. When we woke up the next day, put on a very specific amount of thermal underwear and sweaters, we received a message from the bus company, informing us that the bus tour was canceled due to the freezing temperature.

Since we did not wanted to spend two whole days in our hotel room, we decided to do our own walking tour, stopping for a hot chocolate at a coffee shop whenever we feel the need to warm up. At first, I was skeptical since I never went outside at such freezing temperatures before (yes, they dropped even more: we had -21°C this morning). However, we mainly did this roadtrip because all three of us wanted to spend some time in Chicago, so we put on our warmest jackets and hot-water bottles in both of our pockets, and drove downtown.   
 The city hit different. Although we were already freezing in the car, the sun was shining the whole day, and I overall never had seen a bluer day (in terms of color). We started our tour at Navy Pier. Since it was so cold, there were barely any other people around, giving the impression that we had the city for ourselves this day. Our thermal closes kept their promises and us warm.

From Navy Pier, we went to downtown to see the “Magnificent Mile” and enjoyed the view from the highest floor at the Hancock building. After a hot chocolate at Ghirardelli’s, we strolled through the city, bought a blanket for my cousin who started to freeze in her stroller, and walked towards Lincoln Park to visit the zoo which, unfortunately, turned out to be closed due to the weather conditions. After seeing Cloud Gate, all three of us started to freeze, no matter how much hot chocolate we drank. In the afternoon, we decided to leave the city with the thousands of memories we made that day.
