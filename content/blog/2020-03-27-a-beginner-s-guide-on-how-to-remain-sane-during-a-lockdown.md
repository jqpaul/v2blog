### A Beginner's Guide on How to Remain Sane During a Lockdown

Don’t get me wrong, I was willing to not leave my house on a Friday night long before this pandemic even started. But as things become more and more serious and uncertain, even I feel the need of some sort of stability and structure. I sat down and wrote down some things that I know will help me with my anxiety during these times.

 1. **Repotting my Aloe Vera**  
    What is it with plants that they calm me down so much? I find an immense amount of peace and joy in potting (and buying!) plants. The fact that green is my favorite color cannot be the only reason for this peace of mind.
 2. **Painting**  
    Sure, you can paint on a canvas but I am actually talking about painting the walls of your room. This pandemic truly makes me do all the things I pushed along for months. You know, these old white walls that are not even really white anymore but have multiple stains from hanging picture frames up and down, and accidently scratching your thumb with not yet dry nailpolish on them (please, don’t ask!)? Now is the time to renew these walls, maybe even relocate your furniture.
 3. **Writing Term Papers**  
    As a student, I do not even have a choice at this point. Thankfully, I only have to write one paper this term, which is about trauma and the motif of dreams in World War I poetry. I’m not gonna lie, my inner psychologist is actually happy with this topic – and it even makes me lose track of time.
 4. **Watching Netflix**  
    This one speaks for itself. Go ahead and binge watch the fifth true crime show this week. You deserve it!

 5. **Organizing your Documents**  
    Unfortunately, this is something I always procrastinate. In October, I will participate in an internship at a German television editorial department in Washington, D.C., and I still have to hand in some papers for my visa. Fingers crossed that Corona won’t put a spoke in this wheel.
 6. **Lettering**  
    Just like planting, this is something that extremely calms me. I could spend hours writing my favorite quotes or lyrics in calligraphy.
 7. **Putting on a Face Mask**  
    I’m talking about skin care here, but the longer I think about this, maybe now is the time to start sewing my own masks. I sure will need them in the future.
 8. **Organizing my Playlists**  
    If you tell me you like all the songs in your playlist equally, you are a liar. My main playlist has 579 tracks (I also own a highly acclaimed road trip playlist btw) and judging by the amount of times I skipped several of them, I know that I outgrew these by now.
 9. **Organizing my _Pinterest_ boards**  
    Same thing (yes, this also applies to your _Dropbox_ account). I think my _Pinterest_ account is the most unorganized thing about me, and lasts from my 2008 punk rock phase until today. It is definitely time to delete some pins, or at least bring them in a structured order.

10. **Learning a new language**  
    I am one of these people that has at least four different workbooks on her shelf, and started three _Rosetta Stone_ courses. Now is the time to actually continue these and to improve my language skills for aaaaaall the travels I am going to take the very second this pandemic is over!
11. **Writing**  
    I have at least three book ideas saved on my computer. Writing brings me inner peace, and it calms me to sometimes get away from it all and create fictional worlds – especially during these current times.
12. **Going for a Walk**  
    Depending on where you live, going for a walk is a great option to get some fresh air and to breathe deeply. I live pretty much in the middle of nowhere and I have never appreciated this more than in the last weeks. As the days are getting warmer, I love to spend some time in nature. Working out is also something that makes me feel good during these times. If you have the chance, relocate your workout outside or open your window. You will feel the difference!
13. **Checking Application Deadlines**  
    Although it feels like this year -or even March- will never end, it will at some point. As I am in the final throes of my studies, it is time for me to think about my future. In Germany, it is common to complete a journalistic traineeship in order to work in media. Since I study to become a journalist, now might be the right time to check when to apply for these traineeships.

I guess what this list of things shows is that the best thing I can do during this pandemic is to keep myself busy, both physically and mentally. I hope this gives you some inspiration to achieve the things you wanted to achieve for a while now but couldn’t find the time to do so. NOW is the time!
