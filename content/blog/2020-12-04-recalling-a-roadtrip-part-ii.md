###### North Platte – Omaha – Coralville

After just one night in North Platte, Nebraska, we decided to hit the road again – this time with a specific destination in mind. My aunt used to live in Omaha, still Nebraska, and always gushed over the comparatively small town. Before, I didn’t know a lot about the city except for the fact (and really don’t ask me why I know specifically that) that the actor Adam DeVine was raised there.

Downtown Omaha is comparatively small, which makes the city feel cozy and personal – the fact that it was -15°C might’ve contributed to that fact as well. We ate in a lovely restaurant and strolled through the city, admiring the architecture and the overall charm of it before heading to our hotel, spending our night watching TV and listening to my aunts stories about her timing living in the city. I honestly couldn’t imagine a better way to end this day.

Unfortunately, due to our time schedule and the hand-over of the keys to the new house in Maryland, we couldn’t stay longer in Omaha. I would have loved to spend more time here to see more of this beautiful city.

After hours on the road, we ended crossed state borders and ended up in Coralville, Iowa. The temperatures dropped the more we went east, however the upcoming blizzard stayed behind us. Due to the severe weather conditions we only took a quick stroll through the city, ate one of the best cupcakes I ever had (red velvet and cream cheese ftw) and picked up _Panera_ for dinner for the fifth time in the last three days.

Coralville was our last stop before going to Chicago where we wanted to spend three days before heading further east.
