###### Yes, I travelled during a global pandemic.

But, believe me, it was responsible! Let me tell you why: a friend and I had already planned, in the winter of 2019, that we wanted to travel somewhere together in the upcoming summer. As COVID hit in early spring, we saw our plans endangered. However, instead of cancelling the idea to travel together we researched how we could be safe during our trip.

* **Where to go**  
  One perk of living in Europe is that you can easily travel to different countries without necessarily having to board a plane. We both knew from the beginning that we did not want to fly since sitting in a small space with hundreds of other people did not seem like a good idea (and still doesn‚Äôt).  
  We chose Prague üá®üáø and Copenhagen üá©üá∞ as our travel destinations because it would only take respectively five and seven hours by car to get there. Sitting in a small space with just one person next to you felt much more safe.

* **Where to sleep**  
  Just like we wanted to avoid masses on the plane, we also did not wanted to be around many people when we reached Prague. We chose a small hotel for our stay, not only to have a bit more privacy and a less crowded breakfast hall but also to support a smaller independent hotel during this financially challenging time. We stayed at the ‚ÄúGolden Star‚Äù which was the best decision ever! It was not directly located in the city center but in the beautiful quarter _Mal√° Strana_, close to Prague Castle. Another perk of this hotel: we had the best view on Prague Old Town.

* **When to go sightseeing**  
  There are a view places you have to visit in Prague. Of course, we weren‚Äôt the only tourists in the city, and of course everyone wanted to see the Charles Bridge or the astronomical clock. However, we managed to avoid the tourist's rush hours, mainly by going to see these places early in the morning. By doing so, we managed to be the only people in both _Vrtba Garden_ and _St. Nicolas Church_ (which is also very convenient, if you want to take plenty of pictures without anyone walking through them).

* **What if things get worse**  
  I am the last person that you have to convince that travelling is fun, however, one has to realistic. Travelling during a global pandemic is and will be a risk, not only for yourself but also for the loved ones you left at home. When the number of infections increased again everywhere in Europe, we decided to cancel our second trip to Copenhagen. Although we both really wanted to go there, we knew that it simply would not have been the right thing to go. We both have parents and grandparents at home who we did not wanted to endanger. And we knew that this trip is not cancelled, just rescheduled. On the bright side, we now have something to look forward to after this pandemic is over!
