Although it feels like I havenâ€™t left the house since March, I still somehow managed to visit some places. I want to take the time to recap this very untypical, very weird year:

###### January ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¨

I went to visit my grandparents in Spain which basically means I started my year by jettisoning my New Yearâ€™s resolutions right after I wrote them down, and ate my way through paella and _pastel de nata_. One could definitely say, things could have been worse (little did we know, at this point).

###### February ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¨

My flight back home was delayed to such an extent that I would not catch my connecting flight from Madrid to Hamburg. I, therefore, was forced to stay two days longer in paradise â€“ what a shame! I spent my days hiking and swimming in the ocean.

###### March ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º

After spending a few days in Kiel to work on a film project, I flew to Budapest with my two best friends for a couple of days. At this point, we heard about this foreign thing called Coronavirus but didnâ€™t think much of it. Boy, were we wrong! We ended up booking a completely new return flight to make it out of the country just in time before Hungary closed its borders (you can read about this whole experience [here](https://ataraxisom.com/posts/i-was-out-of-the-country-when-i-realized-that-covid-was-serious/)).

###### April ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I turned 25, but honestly donâ€™t remember much more of what happened during this month. Have I left the house? Have I even showered? Nobody knows.

###### May ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

My parents bought a sail boat in the Netherlands by the end of 2019, which needed to be transferred to Germany. I wrote a [German blogpost](https://ataraxisom.com/posts/nachts-auf-der-nordsee/) about my experiences on the North Sea in the middle of the night that, among other things, include being almost run over by a containership, and peeing in a bucket.

###### June ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

Reading what I have written so far, I canâ€™t believe how good my year has actually been up to this point. And summer was still to come. As the restrictions were eased, I started to leave my house again, went to dinner with friends, and enjoyed the sunny weather outdoors (but still in my countryside home where there are more cows than people).

###### July ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹

I packed my car with loads of snacks and one of my best friends, and drove to Prague. We had such a great time, strolling through the city. If you want to know how we planned this trip to be COVID-friendly (or adversely?), [this blogpost](https://ataraxisom.com/posts/4-tips-to-travel-responsibly-during-covid/) might be interesting for you.  
I also finalized one of my New Yearâ€™s resolutions â€“ going somewhere I havenâ€™t been before â€“ and went to Vienna with my mum (here you can find [part one](https://ataraxisom.com/posts/ein-wochenende-in-wien-teil-1/) and [two](https://ataraxisom.com/posts/ein-wochenende-in-wien-teil-2/) of this trip).

###### August ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I wrote my last exam ever for Uni and usually wanted to celebrate that with another roadtrip, this time to Copenhagen. However, as the cases all around the world increased, me and the same friend I went to Prague with last month decided to stay home. Instead, I went to the Baltic Sea and spend some time in solitude on my parentsâ€™ boat. Oh, and I saw the majority of my family again for the first time in eight months!

###### September ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

Another trip to the Baltic Sea.

###### October ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

Another trip to the Baltic Sea.

###### November ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

Another trip to the Baltic Sea.

###### December ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

I spent my days decorating the house for Christmas (suppressing the thought that I wonâ€™t see my family from overseas this year), baking, and finally leaving this year behind on New Yearâ€™s Eve.

Well, look at this list!  
Personally, this year wasnâ€™t as bad as I felt it would be. Although I could not start my (highly anticipated) internship in Washington, D.C. in October, and I havenâ€™t seen my goddaughter and godmother in over a year now, I made other experiences which I obviously tended to belittle.
